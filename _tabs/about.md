Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for visiting my blog.

I am Sujin, and I am currently working as a data engineer. I am an ML enthusiast and interested in applying machine learning to the neuroscience field. I am also interested in explainable AI, computational neuroscience, and brain-computer interfaces (BCI).

I hope to meet people with similar interests to communicate with.
